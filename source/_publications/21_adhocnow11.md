abstract: |
  Convergecast traffic pattern is predominant in current wireless sensor networks.
  Few packets are periodically sent toward the sink, but interesting events may generate a
  burst of packets for a limited period of time. Such burst may create congestion in the
  surrounding of the event and thus may result in packet loss. Several congestion avoidance
  solutions exist in the literature but they either involve a lot of control messages or
  complicate the deployment of sensor networks. We therefore propose a new approach, named
  CLOMAC, which can be integrated to existing preamble-based MAC protocols.CLOMAC reduces
  congestion by overhearing and passively creating alternative paths toward the destination.
  An evaluation by simulation will demonstrate the benefits of our contribution integrated
  with the B-MAC protocol.
